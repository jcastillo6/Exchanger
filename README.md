# Exchanger
This exchanger app was made to provide backend service to the angular app, this backend app was made in spring boot, and it offers to basic services to query the currencies and another to exchange an amount between them. 

This app consumes two services from http://api.exchangeratesapi.io, so you will need a key from that site to use this app. (that key goes on a property value)

This app uses basic authentication, by default the name is user1 and the password is user1Pass
